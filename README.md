# json-to-atlas (with aseprite)

This app is meant to turn Aseprite Json File into an SpriteAtlas.
just open aseprite and slice (shift+C) the sprites you want to have in the atlas and name them. Export this into JSON (Ctrl+E) and open this Json in this app.
now The .txt file is added in the same directory as the json file itself. 
now you can import the atlas in e.g Libgdx
